        The AI Interview Simulator is a full-stack platform that replicates technical interview scenarios using AI for real-time feedback. Built with React with vite (frontend), Node.js (backend), and Flask (AI service), it offers users practice in technical interviews. The platform features audio recording, speech-to-text transcription via OpenAIâ€™s Whisper, and performance grading based on custom NLP algorithms. User sessions are secured with Google OAuth and JWT authentication, while RabbitMQ handles communication between services. MongoDB stores interview data for tracking progress. Designed for low-latency, actionable insights, it helps candidates refine their interview skills effectively.
